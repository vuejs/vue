- put all API methods on Seed
- add a method to observe additional data properties
- add `lazy` option
- add directive for all form elements, and make it consistent as `sd-model`
- add escape: {{{ things in here should not be parsed }}}
- properties that start with `_` should also be ignored and used as a convention: `$` is library properties, `_` is user properties and non-prefixed properties are data.
